# changingFolder
simple filing system that puts files in a specific folder depending on it's type

#how to use

to use the program, just put the folder to track path in the appropriate variable and for each file type you want to include add a path to folder destination

#for windows user

add another backslash (\) to the path, otherwise python freaks out
